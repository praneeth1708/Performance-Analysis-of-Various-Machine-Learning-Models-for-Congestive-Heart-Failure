# Performance-Analysis-of-Various-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Congestive-Heart-Failure
Heart failure (HF) is a worldwide epidemic 
that causes significant illness and death in the elderly 
population. HF contributes significantly to the difficulty 
and expense of national healthcare. Despite this, HF isstill 
related to a sub-optimal diagnosis. About half of those 
diagnosed with HF pass on within the next five years of 
their diagnosis. The increase in the number of people 
suffering from cardiovascular disorder and the deaths 
caused by these diseases is on the top of the list of causes 
of death. People with heart disorder will live longer if they 
are diagnosed and treated early. In recent years, with the 
advancement of artificial intelligence technologies in the 
sphere of health, artificial intelligence models with 
prediction and classification capabilities that willsupport 
patients and health workers have been created. According 
to the health records and life information of the patients 
used in the heart failure data collection, the heart disease 
mortality status was listed in this report. This research 
seeks to assess the mortality associated with 
cardiovascular disorder using clinical records and patient 
knowledge and to guide patients and doctors to early 
diagnosis and treatment approaches. Various machine 
learning algorithms were used to run classification 
procedures, and the performance rates were shown. 
Various algorithms have been tested with performance 
rates ranging from 86 to 98.3%. The Random Forest 
Classifier algorithm provides the most efficient 
classification method among the tried algorithms.
